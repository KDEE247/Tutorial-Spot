Tutorial Spot for tracking academic records of students...

A Solo Project by Kayode Ogidan for Webstack Portfolio Project.

The aim of this project is to track students performances effectively.

I decided to do this project alone, & work on my terms, based on research.

This effectively affords me the opportunity to guarantee timeliness, void of availability constraints.
